# global-health-trend-analyzer

This Python script, global_health_trends_analysis.py, is designed to analyze and visualize global health trends. By leveraging public datasets, the script provides insights into metrics like life expectancy, disease incidence, healthcare accessibility, and other indicators across different countries and time periods.

# Features
1. Data Loading and Cleaning: Loads data from CSV files, performs cleaning and preprocessing for analysis.
2. Statistical Analysis: Provides insights into health indicators, such as trends over time and country-specific comparisons.
3. Visualization: Generates plots to illustrate key health trends globally and by region.

# Prerequisites
This script requires Python 3 and the following libraries:
pandas for data manipulation
matplotlib and/or seaborn for visualizations
numpy for numerical operations

To install these dependencies, run:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy

# Usage
1. Prepare the Data: Ensure your health data is in a compatible CSV format. The script assumes columns that typically include country, year, and health indicators (e.g., life expectancy, mortality rate).
2. Run the Script:
python global_health_trends_analysis.py
3. Output: The script will produce statistical summaries and visualizations of the analyzed health data.

# Example Visualizations
1. Life Expectancy Trends: Line plots comparing life expectancy over time by region.
2. Healthcare Access: Bar charts of healthcare access levels across different countries.
3. Disease Incidence Rates: Heatmaps showing the incidence of diseases over time.

# Customization
To adjust the analysis for specific indicators or regions:
1. Open global_health_trends_analysis.py in a text editor.
2. Modify the dataset path or filter conditions in the script to fit your data and analysis goals.
3. Run the script again to generate customized results.
